In addition this application is based off of the project described in [Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=1F1DDE581D3E4605A1AF) created by [Andrei Neagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie) and [Yihua Zhang](https://github.com/ZhangMYihua).
